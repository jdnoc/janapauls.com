  subtitle: Be Part Of The Mission
  text: "Maybe you cannot travel and preach right now or are getting ready to do so
    in your near future, or you are anointed to be in business rather than ministry,
    then this is a way to lay up treasure in heaven. Those who send money into the
    mission field are a vital part of the work that takes place to expand the kingdom
    of God. \nIf you would like to be a continual blessing to the ministry you can
    become a monthly partner and join my  prayer and support team right from your
    home :)"
