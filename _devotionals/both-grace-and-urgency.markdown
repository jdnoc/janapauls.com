We are in the end times and people are trying to stop the preaching of the Gospel. That's why boldness is so important, we have to preach with boldness and we have to respect the word of God above the law. When times become hard, there will be a great falling away of the church. You have to make your decision. People will lose their faith because they are taught the ways of the world and are concerned with making people feel comfortable, they don't want to offend anyone. People can't handle the Bible anymore, because they are preached to so much about grace and love. They are not preached about urgency. There has to be both. 

“And He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.” (Mark 16:15)

120 people got filled with the Holy Ghost and fire, they were scattered abroad and all of them preached Jesus. Why would God give you the Holy Spirit, and not want you to do anything? He wants you to win souls. This commission is for every single believer.

Jesus said unto them, GO. Not when you feel ready, not if you feel like it, He says “GO”. The word “go”, in the imperative form is in the Bible 1,492 times. If God says something one time we should do it, if He says it two times, we really need to pay attention. If He says it 1,492 times, we better make sure to do it. 

If the Bible says “go” and you don’t go, that means you're being passive, and you are being disobedient. They went into the upper room, and then they went out of the upper room. When we pray and go people will be saved, set free, healed and delivered. 

When is the right time to go? Now! If the Bible says it you have to do it without confirmation. 

I encourage you to seek and pray for a deeper understanding of both God's grace and urgency, we have to have a revelation of both! Ask God to transform you and go without hesitation!
