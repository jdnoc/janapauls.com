“Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? Behold, I say unto you, Life up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest” (John 4:35)

Jesus tells us that the harvest is ripe! You can tell somebody about Jesus and they will receive Him right now. You don't have to do prayer walks for one year to get people ready for the gospel. We pray! But not for people to be ready sometime to hear the gospel. We pray, get full of power, and go and preach and demonstrate. The harvest is already ripe.

“And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that he that soweth and he that repeth may rejoice together” (John 4:3)

The fruit that they harvest is people brought to eternal life. Jesus is talking about people getting saved. When you don't walk in the fruit of the spirit it is very hard to get people saved. When you don't have joy, I wouldn't even want to listen to you. If you come up to me with a sad face, I don't want to receive what you have. What joy awaits, the planter and the harvester alike. When somebody says that they have heard that God loves them, it means someone else already planted the seed. Some people don’t understand how to “harvest", all they do is go out and have good conversations with people and maybe even pray for them but they never actually lead them to a point of decision to accept Jesus Christ! And they encourage themselves by saying “I’ve sown seed”, yet they never harvest anything! The bible says that the harvest is ripe, that means MANY people are willing and open to receive Christ right now! 

“For He says: In an acceptable time I have heard you, And in the day of salvation I have helped you.” Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.” (2 Corinthians 6:2)

Some people say its not the right time for some people to be saved. Where is that in the Bible? My Bible says today is the day of salvation! How long are you going to wait for people to be ready and let them live without Jesus for another day or another week or months and years? What if they die? Are you going to say that they weren’t ready for Jesus? That is not the Holy Spirit. Jesus clearly said “Do not wait”. He said “Do not wait like there is another 4 months”. The bible doesn’t command us to try to find out if people are ripe. That's not your job! Your job is to get the harvest. Of course there will always be people that reject the gospel, but that is not because they are not ready and surely not because you preached to them at the wrong time. IT IS ALWAYS RIGHT TO PREACH THE GOSPEL!!! Always point people to the bible. We obey the word of God, not the spiritual stuff people say. 

Stop waiting for the right time and step out in faith.
Keep witnessing and preaching to people because the harvest is ripe and it is plentiful!
