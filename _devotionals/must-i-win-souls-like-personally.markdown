Must I win souls? Like personally?

“The fruit of the [consistently] righteous is a tree of life,
And he who is wise captures and wins souls [for God—he gathers them for eternity].”
Proverbs 11:30 (AMP)
 Those who are [spiritually] wise will shine brightly like the brightness of the expanse of heaven, and those who lead many to righteousness, [will shine] like the stars forever and ever.
Daniel 12:3 (AMP)

The answer to the question is YES, unless of course you are spiritually stupid because the WISE WIN SOULS. And I don’t think only Evangelists are supposed to be WISE. There was actually no evangelists in the old testament by the way. Selah. 
The Bible gives us a COMMISSION, not an option or suggestion, to preach the gospel of Jesus to EVERY CREATURE. I mean Mark 16:15 CANNOT be any clearer:

 “And He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.”

How can people misinterpret this scripture? How do you exempt yourself from that? People even use other scripture against this one in order to justify the fact that they are not winning souls. Sorry to tell you, there is no excuse for keeping the gospel massage for yourself (parable of the talents). And no, you cannot preach the gospel without using your mouth to actually speak to people. Romans 10 clearly explains that the lost can not call on Jesus if they never heard the gospel with their ears. So lets not get over spiritual and come up with all kinds of ways to make this complicated because it isn’t. You either use your mouth to reach the lost or you are BOUND by FEAR or PRIDE or RELIGION or all of the above.

Let’s face the facts. Let’s be honest. If I told you to go down the street and talk to the first person you see and pray the prayer of salvation with them, WHAT IS HOLDING YOU BACK?
It is definitely not God, Jesus or the Holy Spirit. How do we know that? Because the same Holy Spirit that inspired the scripture in Mark 16:15, spoken straight from the mouth of Jesus, who only said what He hears the Father say, would never tell you to not preach to that person. God is not schizophrenic!
WHATEVER is holding you back to lead people to Jesus IS NOT FROM GOD, period! 
And supporting your husband or wife or a missionary or an evangelist to do it doesn’t cut it, because YOU are still bound by something. Obviously not everyone is called to be a full time Evangelist, but the Evangelists alone cannot reach every person around you because they may never meet them.

God wants the gospel to be preached to every single person on this earth, regardless if they want to receive it or not, regardless if they ever want to join a church, regardless if they like it or not! Jesus and the disciples preached to people who were hard hearted, religious even violent wanting to kill them ALL THE TIME. It says no where in the Bible to only preach to people you are able to follow up and bring to your church and baptise in water.

SERIOUSLY do you think god FORBIDS believers that are not full time Evangelists to preach the gospel to someone and lead them to Jesus? Do you think He would rebuke you and say “how dare you tell this creature about Jesus when I didn't give you a prophetic word or a vision and confirmed it with my audible voice?” 
Come on! How ridiculous can this topic get? 
Of course we believe in the leading of the Holy Spirit and all His gifts, but He would never tell you NOT to preach to someone. Neither because you are not ready or special enough nor because that person is better of not hearing the gospel and should just go to hell.
What if someone has one more day to live and you encounter them for 5 minutes? Didn’t the thief on the cross get saved? (Luke 23:43) He didn't even verbally repent, but he confessed JESUS AS LORD and God alone saw into his heart and saved him that same moment. 

“Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. And of some have compassion, making a difference: And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.”
Jude 21-23

It’s one thing if you don’t think you can win souls or you don’t know how, you can be trained and equipped, but it is wrong to refuse to win souls and not care about the lost, because that is nothing like Jesus and brings shame on his glorious Name by which people must be saved. People that don’t care about the lost are not even saved because the love of God is not in them.
But our God is very patient and gracious and He can break you out of FEAR or anything that holds you back, by the power of the Holy Spirit.
 Of course there is a lot of arguments, but I don’t want to turn this article into a whole book. 
It comes down to this one thing:

THE ONLY THING YOU CAN TAKE WITH YOU TO HEAVEN IS SOULS.

No one can do it for you. So do it!
