**Isaiah 43:16-19**
"16 Thus saith the Lord, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;
17 Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.
18 Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.
19 Behold, **I will do a new thing**; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert."

What if you are called to do something no one has done before you? A new thing?

Like this guy called Moses in the Old Testament. He did a whole lot of things no one had done before him. He had no human example or leader to equip him for his ministry.
But God promised Him that He would be with him. ALL THE WAY.
All the way to the Red Sea. The obstacle between Moses, a few million Israelites and the promised land. 
Seemed like the end. Seemed like the greatest miracles were behind them.
BUT GOD MAKES A WAY WHERE THERE SEEMS TO BE NO WAY!
He did a bunch miracles before this but He did something new, once again. 

Wait we know it was God, but He didn't do it without Moses. Moses had to stretch out his arm and lift up his rod by FAITH to see the obstacle move SUPERNATURALLY, to see a new miracle.

Do we not believe in the same God Moses did??? Is He not the same God today as He was then? Yeah you say, I would have the faith to split that sea if God had spoken to me through a burning bush and sent 10 plagues on my enemies. But Jesus said "Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed." (John 20:29).

Faith comes from knowing God. Knowing His will. And it is activated and working by Love (Galatians 5:6).

The love of God for you, will split the sea for you as soon as you lift up the rod by faith to see it happen.
I'm not sure which preacher said this first but they said "If you can't see it on the inside, you will never see it on the outside."

If you know the Exodus story, you will know the Israelites were in big trouble, they would have gotten killed if God didn't split the sea open through Moses. Maybe you don't see the need for such great faith because your life is not in danger or you're not responsible for a few million people. 
Well, we forget that there is a lost and dying world out there, and if you don't preach the gospel to them to hinder them from going to hell, then who will?

No matter what your calling is, if it is from God it is always about reaching the Lost.
The strongest force that will pull you right into the high calling of God is a deep love for Him and a burning love for people. 

Do you think there is NO WAY you could preach to the lost? There is NO WAY you could go on a mission trip? There is NO WAY you impact thousands maybe millions of people? There is NO WAY I could _________(fill in the blank)???
Do you not believe God who split the Red Sea could make a way for YOU???
Whatever problem or obstacle you are facing, will it take a greater miracle than splitting a sea wide open? No? Could it be possible God is willing to do a smaller miracle for you?
Is that so hard to believe?
He can change you, He can change your circumstances, He can give you a miracle and He is willing to!

**Romans 8:32**
"Since he did not spare even his own Son but gave him up for us all, wonâ€™t he also give us everything else?"

But you have to lift up the Rod, you have to take a step of faith that may look ridiculous and seem crazy to others, but don't let people who know a small God hinder you from experiencing the God that split the Red Sea for His people.
You are His. Trust Him.

Walk by FAITH.
