**Isaiah 43:16-20**
"16 Thus saith the Lord, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;
17 Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.
18 Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.
19 Behold, **I will do a new thing**; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.
20 The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen."

What if, on top of that, no one is joining you to help you fulfil that call. No one is cheering you on or supporting you, let alone going with you.

I was 19 when I got on that plane, alone. Leaving everything and everyone I knew, to go to the states, where I knew nobody. For 9 months, or at least so I thought at first. All I knew was that God wanted me there to go to Bible school.

On top of that I had no money! *crying laughing emoji*
But that's another story.

But I knew without a doubt God was with me. That's all I needed to know.
He made a way for me.

It is a supernatural thing to walk on a path that is not visible to us.

**2 Corinthians 5:7**
"For we walk by faith, not by sight"

I always thought the opposite of faith is fear, but it is not. Sight is the opposite of faith.
We don't need to believe in what we can see, we register it as real just by looking at it.
Faith is
