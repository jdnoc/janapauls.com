“But you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.” (2 Timothy 4:5 AMPC)

Winning souls does not make you an evangelist, but you are doing the work of an evangelist. You have one main ministry, but that does not mean that you don’t watch the other things that you should do. Be watchful of all things, endure affliction. 

“Now I say this, that each of you says, “I am of Paul,” or “I am of Apollos,” or “I am of Cephas,” or “I am of Christ.”  Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, lest anyone should say that I had baptized in my own name. Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Besides, I do not know whether I baptized any other. For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.” (1 Corinthians 1:12-17)

Paul baptized people but he said “Jesus didn’t send me to baptize.” Does that mean that he was being disobedient to Jesus because he was baptizing people. No. Why? Because it needs to be done! Even though it’s not Paul's main ministry, he still did it. 

Do you think if you win souls God will rebuke you, and say “No, I didn't call you to do that?”

People pick one thing that they are comfortable with, and the rest they chose not to do. Every single person is called to win souls. We are all called to be imitators of God. 

I challenge you to set a soul goal for this week and put it on your mirror so you see it every day.
