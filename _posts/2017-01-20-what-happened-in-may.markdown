In the beginning of the moth of May I was invited to speak for Pastor Bill Wilson to his staff and Interns at [Metro Child Ministries](http://www.metroworldchild.org/?_ga=1.143844028.84859438.1464789981) in Brooklyn New York. He has impacted my life greatly as a teenager when he came to preach at a youth conference in Germany and I was beyond excited when he asked me to preach about answering the call of God. A big part of his staff and interns are actually from Germany and Switzerland so the message hit close to home for them.

During the week I joined the street teams who minister to kids in some of the roughest areas in New York City.

One of the days I saw a drunk guy hitting and yelling at his girlfriend in the middle of the street, he even bit her in the face.. how messed up can you get? I jumped off the ministry truck and went to her when she crouched down at the corner crying. I told her to dump the guy and give her life to Jesus and she prayed with me and hugged me as she thanked me for taking the time to pray with her. I was hoping that skinny joke of a man would come back so I could put my martial arts training into practice, but he didn't.

I got to minister in some of the children's homes during some follow up visits and also do a Bible study with 6 teenagers that one of the staff members disciples since they left the kids program.

Friday night I also had the opportunity to preach at Metro Youth where over 20 young people gave their lives to Jesus!

I have been to 8 states in America and have never seen such need in the inner cities as I did in NYC. Drugs, alcohol, violence, prostitution, broken homes... 

The ministry pastor Bill founded has been going and growing since 1980. The only reason people in the ghetto even recognize it because HE DIDN'T GIVE UP! Most people try to make a difference, get frustrated and quit.

But as ministers of almighty God we do not have that option!

This is my sermon to the staff and interns at Metro Ministries in NYC.

From NYC I flew down to Florida to be part of the Spring Ministers and Leaders Conference at Revival Ministries Intl.

God has spoken to me so strongly during every single one of the 16 meetings.
