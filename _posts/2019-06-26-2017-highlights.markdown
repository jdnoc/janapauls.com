I would like to share Romans 1:17 with you:
"For in the Gospel a righteousness which God ascribes is revealed, both springing from faith and leading to faith [disclosed through the way of faith that arouses to more faith]. As it is written, The man who through faith is just and upright shall live and shall live by faith."

There is NOTHING like being in the perfect will of God and whatever His plan is for your life it always involves to go from faith to more faith and again to more faith and more faith after that. You get the point.
As I am stretching myself to believe God for more souls and more nations to reach with the gospel this year you can do it together with me.

Exciting things already happened in the last six weeks.
January 13-15 I preached three services at the River Rochester Church, lives were touched and changed and believers were baptised in the Holy Spirit.

This precious young woman in the picture above was testifying how she was touched in the meetings and how the Lord used her to minister healing to her mother. She decided to go to Bible school this coming August but she went home to be with Jesus a week after this picture was taken. Because the devil did this I will put as many young women in the ministry as possible. 
Do not waste your time.
Eternity is forever and you decide if you enter into it with empty hands or loaded with eternal treasure.
The only way to lay up treasure in heaven is to invest into the expansion of the kingdom of God. You can do that by financing the work of the Lord and by winning souls yourself.
Nothing matters more than souls.
 
After Rochester I headed to Chicago. I took a friend with me that launched in the ministry not too long ago. And no we did not just take a vacation. A Romanian pastor who saw me preach in Beirut Lebanon invited me to minister in two Romanian churches in Chicago. The first night over thirty showed up in his home to get ministered to and all who desired it were baptized in the Holy Spirit that evening! I also shared at a prayer meeting and had a revival service at "God will provide church" where the altar was packed with people dedicating their lives to Jesus, getting baptized in the Holy Ghost and receiving healing in their bodies. We serve a glorious God!

Over 30 people committed their lives to Jesus and over 20 people were baptised in the Holy Spirit. Two young men told me that they felt as if the wind of God blew on them and sat with me to ask me questions for a long time after the service. There is a great hunger for the Lord in this generation. I recruited quiet a few people to come to RBI and I'm believing God to raise up mighty ministers.

From Chicago I headed over to Tampa Florida for the Winter Camp Meeting with my pastors Rodney and Adonica Howard Browne. It was absolutely phenomenal to say the least. 

After that week I was fired up and ready to go to my next destination Aguascalientes in Mexico with my dear friends pastors Isaac and Lara Gutierrez. I ministered to the women and their whole congregation and did soul winning training and revival meetings at their church and multiple other churches in the city.

Over 120 women came to the women's breakfast and service that you see in the picture below. The healing altar call was packed and over 30 women received their healing that day! My Photographer answered the altar call for the baptism in the Holy Ghost so no pictures there lol

A minimum total of 643 souls were added to the Kingdom, not just in the altar calls but through soulwinning training. About 70 people were mobilised to win souls from two churches and led over 300 people to Jesus in walking distance to their churches. Over 30 healings took place at the women's meeting and more in the other churches as well. Every revival service people were baptised in the Holy Ghost, in 5 churches over 170 people began to pray in other tongues! In one church even the pastor answered the call to be baptised in the Holy Spirit. I don't know what denomination that church was, but when 95% start to speak in tongues, including the pastor it is definitely PENTECOSTAL now! Man that was great fun!
It is amazing to me how many believers that go to Spirit filled churches have never received the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the evidence of speaking in tongues. Last year I was at a church in Africa with over 500 people and about 480 of them did NOT pray in tongues! Directly after that I was at a new church in Europe and they specifically asked me to teach on tongues because 80% of their church are new believers and haven't received the baptism yet. That Sunday everyone, including the children began to pray in tongues!
Why should any believer go without that gift for one more day? 
It became a huge passion of mine to not only get people saved but also baptised in the Holy Spirit. As an evangelist I cannot stay and keep teaching people everything there is, they need the teacher the Holy Spirit on the inside of them!
That prayer language is too powerful and important to live without. Get people filled! Just like you can give salvation so someone through a prayer they repeat with their own mouth, you can lay hands on them and impart that gift of tongues and encourage them to use their mouth to speak new words by faith. God will not open anyones mouth for them, when the Spirit fills them THEY will (have to) begin to pray in tongues as the Spirit gives the utterance (Acts 2:4 with emphasise by me).
If you have never believed God to use you to see people baptised in the Holy Ghost by the laying on of your hands, then now is the time! You don't need to be a minister to do it, you just need to be baptised yourself to do it.

So what is next?

Now I am getting ready to go back to Beirut and complete the intermediate level in Arabic studies.
Also I will be working on a certain visa while I am in Lebanon and privately write people to pray for me as soon as that door opens, but you can believe God for favor with me in the process.

Moreover I have been praying and believing God for souls in 30 countries before I turn 30 years old. So I have 11 months time to go to at least 9 more nations, but I'm shooting for more than that. Already Asia and South America is opening up to me, completely new territory that I am very excited about! As soon as I have my confirmed itinerary I will add it to my next newsletter but in my spirit I know this will be a year of many one way tickets and doors opening back to back as I follow where God leads me. By more faith than ever before!

If you have the desire to be a part of spreading the powerful Gospel of Jesus Christ in a lost and dying world and to see revival in the nations all around the Globe you can do so by sowing a financial seed and consider monthly partnership with the ministry God has given me.

No seed is too small when it comes from the heart and God will bring increase!

I just received an amazing message today from a Lady that said:

"To probably sounds super creepy.... well over a year ago [...] I felt the strong urge to learn who you were, so I youtubed you like a champion and found a bunch of videos that I loved but the one where you preached at the River about a year ago on love has stuck with me big time. It's actually made me feel a hunger to personally see souls saved by the masses when before I was fine with supporting ministries so others could do that. So with every bit of my heart I truly am grateful for you and your ministry. [...] I often thank God for you & other bold women who are going out fearlessly sharing Jesus. Thank you again!!"

Also I just received some pictures from Mexico and wanted to share this one with you of one of the Ladies that received complete healing in her body! Glory to our healer Jesus!
