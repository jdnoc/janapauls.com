I would like to share Romans 1:17 with you:
"For in the Gospel a righteousness which God ascribes is revealed, both springing from faith and leading to faith [disclosed through the way of faith that arouses to more faith]. As it is written, The man who through faith is just and upright shall live and shall live by faith."

There is NOTHING like being in the perfect will of God and whatever His plan is for your life it always involves to go from faith to more faith and again to more faith and more faith after that. You get the point.
As I am stretching myself to believe God for more souls and more nations to reach with the gospel this year you can do it together with me.

Exciting things already happened in the last six weeks.
January 13-15 I preached three services at the River Rochester Church, lives were touched and changed and believers were baptised in the Holy Spirit.

This precious young woman in the picture above was testifying how she was touched in the meetings and how the Lord used her to minister healing to her mother. She decided to go to Bible school this coming August but she went home to be with Jesus a week after this picture was taken. Because the devil did this I will put as many young women in the ministry as possible. 
Do not waste your time.
Eternity is forever and you decide if you enter into it with empty hands or loaded with eternal treasure.
The only way to lay up treasure in heaven is to invest into the expansion of the kingdom of God. You can do that by financing the work of the Lord and by winning souls yourself.
Nothing matters more than souls.
 
After Rochester I headed to Chicago. I took a friend with me that launched in the ministry not too long ago. And no we did not just take a vacation. A Romanian pastor who saw me preach in Beirut Lebanon invited me to minister in two Romanian churches in Chicago. The first night over thirty showed up in his home to get ministered to and all who desired it were baptized in the Holy Spirit that evening! I also shared at a prayer meeting and had a revival service at "God will provide church" where the altar was packed with people dedicating their lives to Jesus, getting baptized in the Holy Ghost and receiving healing in their bodies. We serve a glorious God!

Over 30 people committed their lives to Jesus and over 20 people were baptised in the Holy Spirit. Two young men told me that they felt as if the wind of God blew on them and sat with me to ask me questions for a long time after the service. There is a great hunger for the Lord in this generation. I recruited quiet a few people to come to RBI and I'm believing God to raise up mighty ministers.

From Chicago I headed over to Tampa Florida for the Winter Camp Meeting with my pastors Rodney and Adonica Howard Browne. It was absolutely phenomenal to say the least. 

After that week I was fired up and ready to go to my next destination Aguascalientes in Mexico with my dear friends pastors Isaac and Lara Gutierrez. I ministered to the women and their whole congregation and did soul winning training and revival meetings at their church and multiple other churches in the city.

Over 120 women came to the women's breakfast and service that you see in the picture below. The healing altar call was packed and over 30 women received their healing that day! My Photographer answered the altar call for the baptism in the Holy Ghost so no pictures there lol
