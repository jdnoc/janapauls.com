I would like to share Romans 1:17 with you:
"For in the Gospel a righteousness which God ascribes is revealed, both springing from faith and leading to faith [disclosed through the way of faith that arouses to more faith]. As it is written, The man who through faith is just and upright shall live and shall live by faith."

There is NOTHING like being in the perfect will of God and whatever His plan is for your life it always involves to go from faith to more faith and again to more faith and more faith after that. You get the point.
As I am stretching myself to believe God for more souls and more nations to reach with the gospel this year you can do it together with me.

Exciting things already happened in the last six weeks.
January 13-15 I preached three services at the River Rochester Church, lives were touched and changed and believers were baptised in the Holy Spirit.

This precious young woman in the picture above was testifying how she was touched in the meetings and how the Lord used her to minister healing to her mother. She decided to go to Bible school this coming August but she went home to be with Jesus a week after this picture was taken. Because the devil did this I will put as many young women in the ministry as possible. 
Do not waste your time.
Eternity is forever and you decide if you enter into it with empty hands or loaded with eternal treasure.
The only way to lay up treasure in heaven is to invest into the expansion of the kingdom of God. You can do that by financing the work of the Lord and by winning souls yourself.
Nothing matters more than souls.
 
After Rochester I headed to Chicago. I took a friend with me that launched in the ministry not too long ago. And no we did not just take a vacation. A Romanian pastor who saw me preach in Beirut Lebanon invited me to minister in two Romanian churches in Chicago. The first night over thirty showed up in his home to get ministered to and all who desired it were baptized in the Holy Spirit that evening! I also shared at a prayer meeting and had a revival service at "God will provide church" where the altar was packed with people dedicating their lives to Jesus, getting baptized in the Holy Ghost and receiving healing in their bodies. We serve a glorious God!

Over 30 people committed their lives to Jesus and over 20 people were baptised in the Holy Spirit. Two young men told me that they felt as if the wind of God blew on them and sat with me to ask me questions for a long time after the service. There is a great hunger for the Lord in this generation. I recruited quiet a few people to come to RBI and I'm believing God to raise up mighty ministers.

From Chicago I headed over to Tampa Florida for the Winter Camp Meeting with my pastors Rodney and Adonica Howard Browne. It was absolutely phenomenal to say the least. 

After that week I was fired up and ready to go to my next destination Aguascalientes in Mexico with my dear friends pastors Isaac and Lara Gutierrez. I ministered to the women and their whole congregation and did soul winning training and revival meetings at their church and multiple other churches in the city.

Over 120 women came to the women's breakfast and service that you see in the picture below. The healing altar call was packed and over 30 women received their healing that day! My Photographer answered the altar call for the baptism in the Holy Ghost so no pictures there lol

![women.jpg](/uploads/women.jpg)

![dios.jpg](/uploads/dios.jpg)

![other.jpg](/uploads/other.jpg)

A minimum total of 643 souls were added to the Kingdom, not just in the altar calls but through soulwinning training. About 70 people were mobilised to win souls from two churches and led over 300 people to Jesus in walking distance to their churches. Over 30 healings took place at the women's meeting and more in the other churches as well. Every revival service people were baptised in the Holy Ghost, in 5 churches over 170 people began to pray in other tongues! In one church even the pastor answered the call to be baptised in the Holy Spirit. I don't know what denomination that church was, but when 95% start to speak in tongues, including the pastor it is definitely PENTECOSTAL now! Man that was great fun!
It is amazing to me how many believers that go to Spirit filled churches have never received the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the evidence of speaking in tongues. Last year I was at a church in Africa with over 500 people and about 480 of them did NOT pray in tongues! Directly after that I was at a new church in Europe and they specifically asked me to teach on tongues because 80% of their church are new believers and haven't received the baptism yet. That Sunday everyone, including the children began to pray in tongues!
Why should any believer go without that gift for one more day? 
It became a huge passion of mine to not only get people saved but also baptised in the Holy Spirit. As an evangelist I cannot stay and keep teaching people everything there is, they need the teacher the Holy Spirit on the inside of them!
That prayer language is too powerful and important to live without. Get people filled! Just like you can give salvation so someone through a prayer they repeat with their own mouth, you can lay hands on them and impart that gift of tongues and encourage them to use their mouth to speak new words by faith. God will not open anyones mouth for them, when the Spirit fills them THEY will (have to) begin to pray in tongues as the Spirit gives the utterance (Acts 2:4 with emphasise by me).
If you have never believed God to use you to see people baptised in the Holy Ghost by the laying on of your hands, then now is the time! You don't need to be a minister to do it, you just need to be baptised yourself to do it.

So what is next?

Now I am getting ready to go back to Beirut and complete the intermediate level in Arabic studies.
Also I will be working on a certain visa while I am in Lebanon and privately write people to pray for me as soon as that door opens, but you can believe God for favor with me in the process.

Moreover I have been praying and believing God for souls in 30 countries before I turn 30 years old. So I have 11 months time to go to at least 9 more nations, but I'm shooting for more than that. Already Asia and South America is opening up to me, completely new territory that I am very excited about! As soon as I have my confirmed itinerary I will add it to my next newsletter but in my spirit I know this will be a year of many one way tickets and doors opening back to back as I follow where God leads me. By more faith than ever before!

If you have the desire to be a part of spreading the powerful Gospel of Jesus Christ in a lost and dying world and to see revival in the nations all around the Globe you can do so by sowing a financial seed and consider monthly partnership with the ministry God has given me.

No seed is too small when it comes from the heart and God will bring increase!

I just received an amazing message today from a Lady that said:

"To probably sounds super creepy.... well over a year ago [...] I felt the strong urge to learn who you were, so I youtubed you like a champion and found a bunch of videos that I loved but the one where you preached at the River about a year ago on love has stuck with me big time. It's actually made me feel a hunger to personally see souls saved by the masses when before I was fine with supporting ministries so others could do that. So with every bit of my heart I truly am grateful for you and your ministry. [...] I often thank God for you & other bold women who are going out fearlessly sharing Jesus. Thank you again!!"

Also I just received some pictures from Mexico and wanted to share this one with you of one of the Ladies that received complete healing in her body! Glory to our healer Jesus!

Great Things in the Working
As you may know I have been back in Beirut Lebanon, since the beginning of March, to continue my Arabic studies. I am so excited to be able to communicate on a basic level with the people in their own language, especially about Jesus :)
Though my main focus is to study the language I do not pass up opportunities to minister. I preached three Sunday Services at the Church of God Bourj Hammoud, a midweek service and also a youth service. Over 50 people dedicated their lives to Jesus at the altar during these services.
I also had the opportunity to preach the Gospel to a group of women of which most never made a decision for Christ and all 23 of them dedicated their lives to Jesus. On top of that I prayed for 5 women with pain in their bodies and Jesus healed all of them!

Right now any further travel plans are on hold because I am believing God to get into one specific country  and my visa has been in the working since the beginning of the month. I was told it may take 3-4 weeks and once it is approved I will travel immediately. The Lord has connected me with a very influential person that is organising a ministry tour for me to multiple cities. The plan is to go for about 10-14 days or longer as the Holy Spirit leads, which is why I have no set schedule until mid-June.
In the natural it is one of the most dangerous places to go right now, but just thinking about reaching the people there with the love and power of God makes my heart explode with so much joy I can't even explain it. I don't think it is wise for me to post publicly what country I am talking about so I won't. 

Once I finished this assignment I will be able to organize my next few tours, one to multiple countries in Asia, another to multiple countries in South America, Europe in the summer and I also have an invitation to two cities in Tanzania. This means traveling internationally every few weeks for the rest of the year.
 I asked God for more nations this year and He is the God who answers! 

In the mean time my R1, religious worker visa, for the USA is also in process! I read that after the initial application it takes at least 4 months to get out of the waiting to process pile into the actual processing pile and then another few months until I have my interview at the US embassy in Germany. I am believing God to have my visa before the end of this year so I can move my base to Tampa Florida.

I know some of you are really praying for me and even asking what I would like prayer for. Right now you can agree with me for the following:
1. A quick visa process for this special Arab nation
2. A quick Visa process for the USA 
3. Many many souls, signs and wonders and miracles
![beirut2.jpg](/uploads/beirut2.jpg)
All these precious people came to be baptized in the Holy Ghost, and as far as I saw all of them began to pray in tongues! Also 2 souls got saved as well :)
You may not see them but there was at least 3 veiled women up front, and it is one of the most amazing things to be able to lay hands on a veiled woman and hear a new tongue from heaven come out of her mouth! God is no respecter of persons!
AND FINALLY!
I am excited to announce that my brand new website

My Secret Mission in the Middle East

Finally in 2017 I knew it was the right time. I had a strong and undeniable witness in my spirit and the Lord made a divine appointment for me with a Lady that would be my key to the nation.
She has been on Television for over 20 years and has a great reputation in the church world and favour with the government. Which means security clearance and VIP status which makes military checkpoints a much faster and smoother process.
She came to Lebanon with her friend to bring me across the boarder by car.
June 23-30 would be an unforgettable week for me.

Our first stop was a village in the mountains which used to be home of about 3100 people (mostly Greek Orthodox Christians), but now many more from surrounding areas that were completely destroyed which you can see down in the valley.

The church I ministered at is Evangelical and has received over 200 new believers in the last year due to the war. I preached a Friday night service, a youth and kids service and did an altar call and prayed for the sick Sunday morning.
About 280 adults, 20 youth and 74 children dedicated their lives to Christ and received assurance of salvation, also 15 people received healing in their bodies.
Here I learned a few things that happened in the church world which created a stronghold in the entire nation. 

There was a "pentecostal" or "charismatic" movement and many believers prayed in tongues until the leaders of those churches began to teach that those who do not pray in tongues are not saved. The pentecostal church went downhill from there and caused a lot of destruction. Religious denominations decided to fight this by reporting to the government which then illegalized the doctrine of "praying in tongues". Any church that teaches it is in immediate danger to be shut down.

My heart was so broken. The pastors and people are open for the Holy Spirit and move in other gifts at times but they are afraid to pray in tongues, even the children. Obviously there is no teaching on the subject whatsoever, and as an outsider I had the great opportunity to preach the truth and demonstrate the gift of praying in tongues and interpretation. I realized it would be a process to restore this gift in the church and it would have to start with the pastor before the rest of the church would be open for it. Thanks to God, the pastors niece was the one who received the baptism in the Holy Spirit in one of the meetings.

The next stop has a population of at least 652,609 people before the war in the country I was in. It is partially destroyed which you will see in the videos.

I had the privilege to preach in two churches there, both located in basements. People were so hungry, I have no idea how long they waited for me to show up because we had to drive for over 2 hours and military check points make the journey even longer. I showed up at the first church before noon, I preached to over 120 women there of which over 100 were not sure of their salvation so the altar was packed. Then over 100 of them needed healing in their bodies so I prayed for every one of them and Jesus healed every single one of them! One Lady could barely walk or stand without shaking and after receiving prayer she received strength in her legs and walked perfectly!

After 3 hours of ministry we drove to the next church in a suburb. The basement was packed yet again with over 100 women and a few men. Here as well besides a few people no one was sure of their salvation or had never publicly confessed Jesus as their Lord so the altar was packed and again almost everyone needed healing from various pain. I prayed a mass prayer and about half of the people received immediate healing but I laid hands on the rest and Jesus healed every single one of them! One older lady was healed from partial hearing and could hear perfectly!

From there we took another road trip about 2 hours (with check points) north west to a place in the mountains. A kind of resort with a population of about 2500 people before the war. They say it is more now because people flee from surrounding areas to safe zones like this one.
I preached at a house church there with about 30 people, yet again none of them had assurance of salvation or were born again. Here the pastor allowed me to preach about the baptism in the Holy Spirit. He told me he received that gift 15 years ago yet he didn't dare but to whisper in tongues. In this church about half of the people received the Baptism in the Holy Ghost and about 20 of them received healing in their bodies. The meeting lasted for over 3 hours. Then I went on 10 home visits, until 11PM at night, praying for salvation and the sick for many families.
In 5 days of ministry about 500 people gave their lives to Jesus and over 250 people were healed from various pain and infirmities.

And it is only the beginning! The ladies that organized this trip for me were amazed at what the Lord did and asked me to join them in their future travels to Jordan and Egypt and to come back to this country in December to do a conference and a Christmas outreach for the children there and bless them with toys. I am believing God to buy thousands of toys and bring their families to Christ!

No one from the west comes to this country, if they do it is for humanitarian reasons but never to preach the Gospel of Salvation through Jesus Christ or to bring healing for the sick. The Lord has opened an incredible door for me and has shown me the restoration the church in this country needs. He told me the true shepherds did not flee from the wolfs and stayed with their sheep. Now the Lord will raise up the true believers and the true pastors from among the ashes.
How powerful is that??

Our Lord is greater than any war, greater than any destruction and as you watch the videos and look at the pictures, I know it is awful but our God is planning something that will overshadow anything the devil is doing.

If you would like to sow into the ministry and my further travels in Europe and Africa you are welcome to do so.
Closer to December I will open up a special account to sow into the children and the upcoming Healing Conference which will require a neutral venue.


July Recap
In the month of July I had the opportunity to minister close to my home town in Germany, travel to Ethiopia and I teach a two week Summer School of Evangelism in Helsinki Finland.
Beginning of July I arrived back in Germany after my life changing trip to the Middle East. During my few days at home I promised to revisit a small new church close to my home town called "Begegnung mit Gott" meaning "Encounter God" church, which full of hungry people. On that second visit on a Tuesday night, 30 people, kids and teenagers packed the place. I ministered for almost 3 hours, 10 people dedicated their lives to Jesus and 6 were baptized with the Holy Ghost and began to pray in tongues, 5 of which were teens or younger and they just kept praying! I was amazed to see such hunger in Germany, it really blessed my heart! Now the pastors of that church decided to come to Holland Ablaze conference with Dr. Rodney Howard Browne and I can't wait to see them set on fire!

This past spring I received an open invitation to Ethiopia which I decided to take this month. I spend a few days in Addis Ababa and preached the Saturday morning service (which is their main service) at Christ Jesus Life Inernational Church. The church broke free in their giving and every single person got out of their seat to bring a sacrificial offering to the altar. I also got to teach at their discipleship class with over 200 students, held one meeting with 30 pastors and leaders where the power of God fell mightily, and preached at their annual youth conference with roughly 7000 young people in attendance. about 150 gave their lives to Jesus, but at the youth conference I also gave a call for everyone that wants the baptism in the Holy Spirit. I am not the best at big estimates but probably about 2000 young people stood up and when I prayed about half of them began to pray in tongues, then I asked who still doesn't pray in tongues and had the people around them lay their hands on them and prayed again and in total at least 1000 people prayed in tongues for the first time! And that is a low estimate because it looked like half the people stood and I have no clue how many of the thousand in the overflow tent were standing up, so it could have been way more than a thousand, but man that was one massive baptism! God did an amazing work!
