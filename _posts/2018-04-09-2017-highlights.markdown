So here is what happened since January!

January - San Pedro Sula, Honduras
In just a few days I got to preach and teach and train 35 people to win souls. 197 people received Jesus

Had the awesome opportunity to share at the River Church during winter camp meeting.
Sunday night service marked exactly ten years since I was baptized in the fire of God. It is mind blowing to see everything that has happened since!

February - South Africa 
I had the awesome opportunity to help out at the "Fire in the Cape" crusade in Cape Town with my pastors Drs Rodney and Adonica Howard Browne.
One of the nights pastor called me up on the stage to speak on the baptism in the Holy Spirit and pray for the people to receive it. Hundreds began to pray in tongues that night!

Spontaneously I was invited to preach in two churches in Cape Town and two churches in Durban where I also did soulwinning training. 72 soulwinners were mobilized, a total of 651 souls came to Jesus Christ and 47 were baptized in the Holy Spirit during my time in South Africa.

in the above picture I was preaching in a shack, a small church that a young pastors couple started recently. I was blown away by the hunger of the people. I actually talked about it in a live video, you can watch it here if you missed it:

Currently I am in Madagascar on a 4 city tour.
Then I am off to Beirut Lebanon, Cyprus, Germany and then the USA in May.

If you would like to sow a financial seed into the ministry and be a part of the harvest of souls, you can do so via PayPal or credit card (the option is on the bottom left on the PayPal page). If you would like to partner with the ministry to see souls saved and bring revival to the nations you can make your payments recurring by checking the box on the same PayPal page.

PayPal has my account under investigation, apparently someone wrote a note mentioning certain countries that are black listed by the US and now they think I got sketchy stuff going on...

Thank you for reading my newsletter and thank you to everyone who blesses me with their support, prayers, finances and every faith filled word send my way. 
Thank you to my pastors, leaders and partners. I thank God for you and pray that He blesses you abundantly for your labor of love toward me.

All the glory goes to God.
Much love and God bless!


Nation #31 check! My first trip to Madagascar was so much better than I expected!
A Malagasy pastor from Beirut connected me with a pastor that planted and oversees multiple churches across Madagascar. 
They never had a foreigner minister at the churches, only a few that have a conference at a hotel for pastors and leaders.
They never had an evangelist come that took care of all the bills so they could never afford one before. So THANK YOU to everyone who has sown into the ministry :)
The churches were packed, altars were packed and 80-90% of all who attended were baptized in the Holy Spirit!
525 people gave their lives to Christ.
310 baptized in the Holy Ghost.
15 people received healing in their body.
Over 1400 km driven... over 45hrs on the road.
And all the glory goes to God!

All churches want me to return and the pastors want me to do a ministers and leaders conference as well, so in God's time that is definitely going to happen!
