VERY HAPPY NEW YEAR!
2018 surely was the year of the more excellent way! The ministry has had a RECORD BREAKING summer! Also new nations and doors opened already in the beginning of the year and more souls were reached and saved than ANY YEAR PRIOR TO THIS ONE!
By the grace if God I was able to minister in 11 countries and 24 cities. 
A TOTAL OF 12 841 people received Jesus Christ!
Over 80% of which heard the gospel on the streets, which is a majority of unchurched people!

New countries I traveled to for the first time were:
#30 Honduras
(which was right before my 30th birthday and I hit my goal of ministering in 30 countries before 30!)
#31 Madagascar
#32 Canada
(I've been there before, but this was the first time I preached there)
#33 Mauritius 

On top of all the salvations, hundreds of believers were trained to win souls, over 406 people received the baptism in the Holy Spirit. 89 people received a physical healing in the meetings and countless more on the streets through the believers that were trained, not only to win souls but to demonstrate the healing power of God!

Revelation 3:8
"I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name."

Here are some picture Highlights and then some more updates on ministry and life, I got some great news!

So here is what happened since January!

January - San Pedro Sula, Honduras
In just a few days I got to preach and teach and train 35 people to win souls. 197 people received Jesus

Had the awesome opportunity to share at the River Church during winter camp meeting.
Sunday night service marked exactly ten years since I was baptized in the fire of God. It is mind blowing to see everything that has happened since!

February - South Africa 
I had the awesome opportunity to help out at the "Fire in the Cape" crusade in Cape Town with my pastors Drs Rodney and Adonica Howard Browne.
One of the nights pastor called me up on the stage to speak on the baptism in the Holy Spirit and pray for the people to receive it. Hundreds began to pray in tongues that night!

Spontaneously I was invited to preach in two churches in Cape Town and two churches in Durban where I also did soulwinning training. 72 soulwinners were mobilized, a total of 651 souls came to Jesus Christ and 47 were baptized in the Holy Spirit during my time in South Africa.

in the above picture I was preaching in a shack, a small church that a young pastors couple started recently. I was blown away by the hunger of the people. I actually talked about it in a live video, you can watch it here if you missed it:

Currently I am in Madagascar on a 4 city tour.
Then I am off to Beirut Lebanon, Cyprus, Germany and then the USA in May!


Nation #31 check! My first trip to Madagascar was so much better than I expected!
A Malagasy pastor from Beirut connected me with a pastor that planted and oversees multiple churches across Madagascar. 
They never had a foreigner minister at the churches, only a few that have a conference at a hotel for pastors and leaders.
They never had an evangelist come that took care of all the bills so they could never afford one before. So THANK YOU to everyone who has sown into the ministry :)
The churches were packed, altars were packed and 80-90% of all who attended were baptized in the Holy Spirit!
525 people gave their lives to Christ.
310 baptized in the Holy Ghost.
15 people received healing in their body.
Over 1400 km driven... over 45hrs on the road.
And all the glory goes to God!

All churches want me to return and the pastors want me to do a ministers and leaders conference as well, so in God's time that is definitely going to happen!

Jesus healed this lady in one of my services and she received new arteries and did not need the heart surgery that the doctors told her she urgently needed or she would die. But she brought the doctors report the next day that she is completely healed!!!

NOW TO THE NEWS:
I have been believing God and waiting for months and months for my US worker Visa so I can officially base out of Tampa, Florida. I just had my final visa interview at the US embassy in Frankfurt Germany, and my Visa was APPROVED!!!
It really is a work of the Lord because of my travel history and previous issues with US boarder control. But when God opened a door NO MAN can shut it!

2 Corinthians 2:14 (KJV)
"Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place."
