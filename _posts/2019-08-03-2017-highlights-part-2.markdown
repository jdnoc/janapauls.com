This past October, after the Ministers and Leaders conference at my Church in Tampa, I was already scheduled to preach in Kiev at a youth conference at "Zerkov Popeda" (Victory Church). Even the week before, I was praying and asking the Lord what to schedule next but there was no release in my spirit so I kept my schedule open, and thank God I did!
I taught a session on Leadership on Friday, took part at a panel discussion on Saturday and preached Saturday morning.
Young people from all over the Ukraine showed up for those meetings.
36 dedicated their life to Christ, followed by a call for the Baptism in the Holy Spirit and all 16 that came began to pray in tongues for the first time! The power of God fell in the place and many were touched and filled.

After my morning session, the senior pastor of an affiliated church that heard me preach asked me if I can come and preach at his church on Sunday. Of course I said YES, my schedule was open :D.
So I packed my bags ready to leave on a night train to Nikolaev (412km/256mi) which arrived at 7 am. I got settled into a nice little apartment and got ready to preach at 11am. 12 people dedicated their lives to Jesus at that little but packed out church and many were touched by the power of God. Monday and Tuesday I taught on Evangelism for almost 6 hrs combined and many of the youth didn't even wait for the weekend to win souls but led people to Jesus even before going home that night!

While I was in Nikolaev, the pastor called around and other pastors invited me to come as well. So Tuesday night I left to go to Odessa, a beautiful City 2.5 hrs south west on the coast of the Black sea. 16 dedicated their lives to Jesus at the altar on Wednesday night and the whole church came to the altar to receive a touch from God. We did two soulwinning sessions and went on the streets one day and over 64 people received Jesus on the streets!
From Odessa I went back to Nikolaev where I preached and laid hands on everyone Friday night and did soulwinning training on Saturday. 66 people received Jesus on the streets that day. One of the soulwinners led over 30 people to Jesus at a feeding program that day!
Early Sunday morning I went to the next city I was invited to, called Kherson, which is about an hour south east of Nikolaev. The church started out of a rehab, so a whole lot of former addicts that got radically saved and set free and are super hungry for God. On Sunday 40 people gave their lives to Jesus at the altar, 16 were baptized in the Holy Spirit and began to pray in tongues and the whole church came to be filled with the power of the Holy Spirit to win souls. Monday I taught on soulwinning and on Tuesday we had another soulwinning class and went out to evangelize. Many came to win souls the and another 61 people received Jesus on the streets!
