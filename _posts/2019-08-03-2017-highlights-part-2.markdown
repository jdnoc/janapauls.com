This past October, after the Ministers and Leaders conference at my Church in Tampa, I was already scheduled to preach in Kiev at a youth conference at "Zerkov Popeda" (Victory Church). Even the week before, I was praying and asking the Lord what to schedule next but there was no release in my spirit so I kept my schedule open, and thank God I did!
I taught a session on Leadership on Friday, took part at a panel discussion on Saturday and preached Saturday morning.
Young people from all over the Ukraine showed up for those meetings.
36 dedicated their life to Christ, followed by a call for the Baptism in the Holy Spirit and all 16 that came began to pray in tongues for the first time! The power of God fell in the place and many were touched and filled.

After my morning session, the senior pastor of an affiliated church that heard me preach asked me if I can come and preach at his church on Sunday. Of course I said YES, my schedule was open :D.
So I packed my bags ready to leave on a night train to Nikolaev (412km/256mi) which arrived at 7 am. I got settled into a nice little apartment and got ready to preach at 11am. 12 people dedicated their lives to Jesus at that little but packed out church and many were touched by the power of God. Monday and Tuesday I taught on Evangelism for almost 6 hrs combined and many of the youth didn't even wait for the weekend to win souls but led people to Jesus even before going home that night!
