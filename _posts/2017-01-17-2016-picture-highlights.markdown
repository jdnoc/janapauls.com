Happy New Year! I hope you had a wonderful Christmas and cross over to 2017, but if not, don't worry, just leave the past in the past and believe God for an amazing year!
The apostle Paul says in **Philippians 3:13**:

> "No, dear brothers and sisters, I have not achieved it, but I focus on this one thing: Forgetting thepast and looking forward to what lies ahead" 

That means good and bad things! Leave everything behind and press in for greater things.

But I do want to give you highlights from 2016, especially if you are a new subscriber to my newsletter. 

## January-February

Personally, the opportunity to preach at the River@Tampa Bay Church marks the greatest privielege I ever had. Walking on that same carpet where I was baptized in the Fire of God and preach from the same pulpit where the Words that changed my life forever were preached is an absolute work of God.

You can skip the following walk down memory lane and just check out the pictures but if you like me just read on, because I do want to say that when I was 19 and I just got to Amerika with my broken English and no clue about ministry or revival, I never thought I could be one of those people standing behind this pulpit and minister in the power of the Holy Spirit. I was a mess and I didn't think God could have any use for me. But then I started to press in and give Bible school and God my all and got the ultimate breakthrough when I was baptized in the Fire of God, January 2008. That day I vowed to the Lord to carry that fire everywhere God gives me the opportunity to go.

Not only did I preach the midweek service but I also got to teach the 2nd and 3rd year River Bible Institute students the following week.
