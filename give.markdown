##BE PART OF THE MISSION

Not everyone is called to the mission field or behind a pulpit, yet everyone is called to be a part of the move of God in the earth. 

This life is short in light of eternity, Jesus is coming back soon and no one should stand before Him empty handed. Win souls and invest into the kingdom of God to bring forth fruit that will last into eternity and to bring glory to our wonderful God.

With every financial seed you sow, you are a part of bringing the life changing power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the nations of the world, to see souls saved and revival spread through the Body of Christ. 

I would like to thank my partners, friends, pastors and supporters for every prayer, financial seed and encouraging word.
It is very precious to me and I do not take it for granted.
