## Support The Mission

With every seed you sow, you are part of preaching the life changing Gospel of Jesus Christ in the nations of the world with signs and wonders following. 

I would like to thank my partners, friends, pastors and supporters for every prayer, financial seed and encouraging word.

It is very precious to me and I do not take it for granted.
