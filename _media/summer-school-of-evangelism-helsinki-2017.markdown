Check out these testimonies from 3 of the students that joined the evangelism school this summer in Helsinki Finland.
People had breakthroughs, many overcame their fear of men and timidity and stepped out of their comfort zone and saw what God can do through their obedience.
There were countless of testimonies, healings and divine encounters and not one student remained the same, but every one of them went on another level in their faith and especially in their boldness.
Some returned that attended last year's school and developed their leadership skills by training up new believers in effective soulwinning.
Even a christian, denominational, newspaper reported about our soulwinners, saying it is not even possible to walk through downtown Helsinki without being witnessed to!
God did an amazing work and with 75 people mobilized, we have seen 4020 people, in 12 days, that received Jesus in their heart!
The harvest is ripe!
