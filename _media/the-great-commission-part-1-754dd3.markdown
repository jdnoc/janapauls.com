bible: "Mark 16:15 \nAnd he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the
  gospel to every creature.\n\nMatthew 16:24\nThen said Jesus unto his disciples,
  If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and
  follow me.\n\nMark 1:17\nAnd Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will
  make you to become fishers of men.\n\nJohn 20:21\nThen said Jesus to them again,
  Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.\n\nJohn 14:12\nVerily,
  verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do
  also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.\n\nLuke
  19:10\nFor the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.\n\nActs
  1:8\nBut ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and
  ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria,
  and unto the uttermost part of the earth.\n\nActs 2:39\nFor the promise is unto
  you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord
  our God shall call.\n\nProverbs 11:30\nThe fruit of the righteous is a tree of life;
  and he that winneth souls is wise.\n\nDaniel 12:3\nAnd they that be wise shall shine
  as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as
  the stars for ever and ever.\n\nLuke 10:27 \nAnd he answering said, Thou shalt love
  the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength,
  and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.\n\n2 Corinthians 5:18\nAnd
  all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath
  given to us the ministry of reconciliation;\n\n2 Timothy 4:5\nBut watch thou in
  all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of
  thy ministry.\n\nMatthew 26:41\nWatch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation:
  the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\n\n2 Timothy 1:7\nFor God hath
  not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.\n\nProverbs
  28:1\nThe wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion."

Is Jesus actually telling YOU today to preach the gospel? Does Mark 16:15 apply to every believer?
