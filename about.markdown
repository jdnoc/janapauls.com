# Hello, I'm Jana!

I travel the world and evangelize to people who need to hear about Jesus. 

I'm both German and Russian. Crazy!

## How did I get where I am today?

Lots of hard work.

## What are my plans for the future?

Lots more hard work.

## A Fun One - My favorite color is [Electric Ultramarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultramarine)!
