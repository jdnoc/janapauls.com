# Hi, I'm Jana!

I travel the world and preach the Gospel.

I'm both German and Russian. I know, what a mix.

## My favorite color is [Ultramarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultramarine)!

## How did I get where I am today?

Majorly the Fire of God. But ultimately my love for my saviour Jesus Christ and His love for me.
Oh yeah and work!

## What are my plans for the future?

Lots more work. Can't take over the nations for Jesus while sitting on your blessed assurance.   


Here is a short Bio:

Jana left her former home Germany straight out of school at the age of 19 to study the Bible full time for 3 years at the River Bible Institute in Tampa Florida. After experiencing the baptism in the fire of God (Luke 3:16), her life was changed for ever.

"I heard the cry of the nations on the inside of me and it shook me to my core. Words cannot describe what it felt like. All I know is that I have to reach the lost with the life changing message and saving power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and carry that fire into the churches to see revival. Especially in places where no one wants to go. Until the whole world knows Jesus is Lord."

Missionary and Evangelist Jana Pauls has been in the full time ministry since graduating Bible School in 2010 with a Bachelors in Theology Degree. 
She was licensed as a minister in 2012 through Revival Ministries International under Drs. Rodney and Adonica Howard Browne. 
In 2014 she was ordained through RMI as well.
She travels internationally to preach and teach the Word of God and train and mobilise believers to bring in the harvest of souls. 
She has ministered across America, Europe, Africa and the Middle East in a total of 21 nations so far and counting.

The mission is revival, the goal is always souls.
