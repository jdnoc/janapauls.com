# Hi, I'm Jana!

I travel the world and preach the Gospel.

I'm both German and Russian. I know, what a mix.

## My favorite color is [Ultramarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultramarine)!

## How did I get where I am today?

Majorly the Fire of God. But ultimately my love for my saviour Jesus Christ and His love for me.
Oh yeah and work!

## What are my plans for the future?

Lots more work. Can't take over the nations for Jesus while sitting on your blessed assurance.
